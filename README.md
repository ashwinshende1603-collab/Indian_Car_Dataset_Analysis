![Indian Car Dataset Analysis](https://www.evolve-h2020.eu/image_temp/1200X628_1200X628_crop_e158717b10b7c79082e001d3c6fd4902.png)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes the **Indian Car Market Dataset** to understand trends in price, mileage, fuel types, and other key performance metrics of cars sold in India.  
The goal is to clean, visualize, and derive meaningful insights using **Python** and its data science libraries.

## 🔍 Data Exploration & Cleaning
1. **Loaded dataset** and explored shape, data types, and summary stats  
2. **Handled missing values** using median/mode imputation  
3. **Detected and removed outliers** using IQR (Interquartile Range) method  
4. **Cleaned inconsistent text cases** (Fuel Type, Transmission)  
5. **Converted datatypes** (e.g., Price → numeric, Year → datetime)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Some of the key analyses performed:
- Distribution of car prices across fuel and transmission types

- Correlation between **price**, **mileage**, and **year**  
- Average mileage comparison across fuel types  
- Top car brands by price and efficiency  
- Outlier visualization using boxplots  

### 📈 Sample Visuals:
- **Price vs Mileage Scatter Plot**  
- **Distribution of Fuel Types (Pie Chart)**  
- **Correlation Heatmap**  
- **Boxplot for Price Outliers**

## 📉 Insights & Findings
🔸 **Diesel cars** generally offer higher mileage than petrol cars  
🔸 **Automatic transmissions** are more common in higher-priced cars  
🔸 Car **prices increase with newer models** (recent years)  
🔸 **CNG cars** provide best mileage but limited availability  
🔸 Outlier removal significantly improved the data consistency

## 🧮 Future Scope
- Predicting car prices using **Machine Learning models**  
- Deploying an **interactive dashboard** using Streamlit or Dash  
- Extending dataset with new EV models for 2025+ market trends
